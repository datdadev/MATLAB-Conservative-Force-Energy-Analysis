# MATLAB-Conservative-Force-Energy-Analysis

## About

This MATLAB project provides a tool for analyzing the energy of a particle under the influence of conservative forces. The conservative force is defined by an expression that depends only on the starting and ending positions of the particle's motion, and the potential energy can be calculated using this expression. The project includes both a script and a GUI for calculating the kinetic and potential energy of the particle as functions of time and provides a graphical representation of the results.

## Requirements

- [MATLAB R2019b or later](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- [MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the [app.mlapp](https://github.com/datdadev/MATLAB-Conservative-Force-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/app.mlapp) GUI file by typing `app` in the command window.
3. In the GUI window, enter the initial position, velocity, mass, and conservative force parameters.
4. Click the "Graph" button in the GUI window to compute the kinetic and potential energies of the particle and plot them on the GUI.
5. Experiment with different parameter values by adjusting the sliders and clicking the "Graph" button again.
